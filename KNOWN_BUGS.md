## Web (JS) — navigation icon not visible

**Symptom.** The navigation (back) icon does not render on the JS/browser target. Reported
2026-08-06. Android, desktop and iOS all show it correctly, so this is target-specific rather than a
regression in the shared composable.

**Where.** Every detail screen now draws its back affordance through one component,
`core/ui/DetailTopBar.kt`, using `Icons.AutoMirrored.Filled.ArrowBack`. The app-level search bar and
`SearchScreen` have their own icons, so a first useful data point is whether *those* icons render on
web too - if they also fail, this is about icon loading in general, not `DetailTopBar`.

**Ruled out.** Not a missing dependency: `libs.material.icons.core` is declared in `commonMain`
(`composeApp/build.gradle.kts:63`), so the JS target inherits it.

**Worth checking, in order.**
1. Whether *any* `androidx.compose.material.icons` vector renders on web, or only this one - 21
   files in `commonMain` import from that package, so a broad failure would be obvious.
2. `Icons.AutoMirrored.*` specifically. The auto-mirrored variants resolve through a different path
   than plain `Icons.Filled.*`; swapping one call site to `Icons.Filled.ArrowBack` is a two-minute
   test of that theory.
3. Tint. `DetailTopBar` tints the icon `onSurface` when solid and white over a hero image. An icon
   drawn in a colour matching its background is invisible rather than absent - check the DOM/canvas
   for a node of the right size before assuming it never drew.

**Blocked on.** Verifying any of this needs the browser target to render at all - see the blank-page
bug below, which has to be fixed first.

## Web (JS) — blank page

**Symptom.** `./gradlew :composeApp:jsBrowserDevelopmentRun` serves on `:8080` but renders nothing.

**Partial diagnosis.** `index.html` carries a stale `<script src="skiko.js">` tag; skiko 0.144.6
ships `skiko.mjs`, meant to be bundled by webpack. That alone should not blank the page, so a second
unidentified 404 is still outstanding.

**Next step.** Log 400+ responses via `page.on('response')` in puppeteer/Chrome DevTools against
`localhost:8080` to find the real missing asset, then fix the stale tag and whatever else 404s.
